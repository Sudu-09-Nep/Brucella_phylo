# 01 – Inputs

This folder contains all input data that are small enough to share in
the repo (reference, focal genome, accession lists, sample table).
Larger NCBI downloads used to generate these files are not committed
here but can be re-downloaded from NCBI using the accessions.

- `ref.fna`: reference genome.
- `my_brucella.fna`: polished assembly of the focal isolate.
- `input.tab`: sample ID + path table for Snippy.
- `gcf_genomes.list`: list of NCBI accessions.
These files define the dataset and the reference context for all downstream steps.
